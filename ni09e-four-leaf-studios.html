It was founded in early 2007 with the goal of creating the visual novel Katawa Shoujo (which is still in development and the group's main focus). Since then, a prologue for Katawa Shoujo. 
First a bit of backstory. Back in 2013 the biggest (and really the only relevant one) newspaper about games in Poland, CD-Action, released a booklet where they talked about some interesting games that are unusual for one reason or another. They divided it into 4 categories: unusual gameplay, idea, contents and form. I remember that back then, I really liked going through this booklet and reading about those weird games, but a few managed to really catch my eye and get me thinking about them. Four Leaf Clover Studio, Laguna Beach, CA. 155 likes. Event styling and decor. Before I talk about my experience with Hanako’s route, let me give y’all some backstory. Like many others, I found out about the existence of this VN when /r/DDLC became a Katawa Shoujo themed subreddit for April Fools day. “Hm,” I thought to myself. Maybe I should play it. After all, I really enjoyed DDLC (my first VN), so I figured that KS would be similar. After playing Hanako’s route, I can say that while it is similar in some aspects, it’s fundamentally very different. While DDLC relies. 
Four Leaf clover studio is a full service event and wedding production firm located in southern california. We believe that an event should be a story--an unfolding of possibilities, fun, beauty The story of how I found the game isn't terribly unique. April fools over on r/DDLC. I'm sure a lot of people found their way over here like that. But I thought I'd share why I stayed, and why I seem to be so utterly consumed by this game. By this story. Tl;dr is that it echoed my own life so closely I couldn't help but love it. I'm not Hisao. I'm not handsome, nor do I have a debilitating heart condition.

Namesake: Song Cover by Soft Cell (Original by Gloria Jones) Origin of Non-JoJo Character: Katawa Shoujo, a visual novel by Four Leaf Studios Appearance: The Stand appears as a large scourge of intelligent telepathic mosquitoes. Each individual member features colorful patterns distinct to that member, and bears its name along its wings. Although the exact capacity of the scourge is unknown, there is one for each distinct emotion a person can feel. Stats: E - Power. Okay, so I'm not a very emotional person, I can probably count the number of times I've cried from emotion on one hand. But this game just gets to me. I've cried at the end of just about every route. (Especially Lilly's which prompted me to write this) Every single one has really really affected me in their own way, and I'm incredibly thankful for it. It's been a great experience, and one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I figured I should share this here to keep track Remember Katawa Shoujo? Of course, you do. It's that indie English visual novel set within a private high school for disabled children. As you might have guessed from the title, Katawa Shoujo. A really cool part of the game I just noticed is the contrast between Hanako and Emi. Both lost a parent or two at a younger age that has scared both of them mentally and physically, with the two of them having nightmares and isolating themselves around the anniversary of the event. However, both of them have handled this (or not handled this) in different ways. Emi has decided that the risk of loosing someone that close to her again drives her to not allow herself to get close to anyone What If I Am The Only One That Actually Uses This Reddit Sub, And Everyone Else That Is A Part Of It Is Just Ignoring It, Which Means That I Am Being Left Out Of Everything.

Maybe four or five years ago a team of KS fans came together to make a VN of their own, which had an early early title of "Katawa Shoujo Plus" at first, to which Four Leaf Studios rightfully objected, so it was changed to Love Despite. It was suppose to be another Visual Novel with a similiar premise, high school for the differently-abled romance game. It's pretty clear the project is dead, but does anyone know what exactly happened. In Katawa Shoujo, users try to seduce high school girls with disabilities—but that's not what makes it interesting. TL;DR is at the end. As of the past few months, I've become incredibly isolated and cripplingly lonely. Due to events in my personal life, as well as medical issues, a predisposition towards introversion and a resurgence in my clinical depression, I have been essentially cut off, socially. I've been falling into a chasm with no way back. I'm a first year university student, who does MMA, teaches scuba diving and plays rugby. Seems to contradict the above, right? I can honestly Four Leaf Studios (or 4LS, for short) is the group that developed and released Katawa Shoujo. After a doujin released in 2000 by Raita Honjou came to light, Four Leaf Studios began work on the visual novel based on a bonus page at the end of the one-shot.

Not very proud of this one, but I saw this game as sort of a joke. "Anime dating Sim?, Jesus japan you sure cater to losers!". I actually enjoy anime, but I saw the whole dating-sim genra as something for desperate people, weaboos, the sort. I was bored so I decided to give it a shot. I was joking at first "What is all the fuss about the weaboo game?". Until I started getting drawn in. The music, art and writing are so good and well mixed that I didn't think, I just felt.
